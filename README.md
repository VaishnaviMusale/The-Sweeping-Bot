# The-Sweeping-Bot
This project aims to develop and modernize road sweeping by creating an obstacle-detecting, garbage-collecting robot using an Arduino microcontroller. The robot features rotating brushes to collect garbage and operates in obstacle avoidance, Bluetooth control, and voice control modes. Designed for ease of use and cost efficiency, it requires minimal human assistance to clean roads and footpaths. This project is based on thorough research and comparisons with conventional designs to ensure optimal performance.

To use this sweeping bot, simply activate the desired control mode and let it navigate and clean the designated area. For detailed instructions and resources, refer to the project documentation and Arduino programming guides.
