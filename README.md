# The-Sweeping-Bot
Overview:
The aim of this project is to develop and modernize the process of sweeping roads by detecting obstacles. This sweeping bot is essentially a garbage-collecting robot designed using an Arduino microcontroller. All hardware and software operations are controlled by Arduino.

Features:
Obstacle Detection: The robot can detect and avoid obstacles.
Garbage Collection: Equipped with rotating brushes, the robot collects garbage detected in its path.
Multiple Control Modes: Operates in three modes - obstacle avoidance, Bluetooth control, and voice control.
Ease of Use: Designed with a simple interface, making it user-friendly in today's busy and smart world.
Cost Efficiency: Developed with cost efficiency in mind, without compromising on performance.

Motivation:
The primary goal is to keep the robot as simple as possible while ensuring it can clean roads or footpaths with minimal human assistance. This makes the project highly useful in daily life. The sweeping bot is designed with a focus on affordability, ensuring that supervisory control is straightforward and cost-efficient.

Development Process:
This project is the result of exhaustive research and comparisons with conventional designs. It incorporates the best practices from various designs to ensure optimal performance.
